## Project Structure:
This project is comprised of four parts: (1) driver(), (2) Portfolio_Parser(), (3) Portfolio(), and (4) Stock().

- **driver():**
    This file serves as a handler for the calculator. Currently requests user input for prtfolio history csv, current date, and cash on hand which it passes to the parser. These values can be hard-coded instead for other use cases.
    The driver requires the use of the **Portfolio_Parser()**, **Portfolio()**, and **Stock()** classes to work properly.
    If implementing this project into other frameworks, please use the current version of this file to serve as a guide for its use.
- **Portfolio_Parser():**
